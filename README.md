WIP. A Conceptual Proof demonstrated with several different toolkits.
 
## Assignment
### Part 1
Each proof should create a basic Admin page with a responsive save button and post data over AJAX. Create title, alias, and content inputs along with a save button that is only active when appropriate. When the save button is clicked the form data should be posted over AJAX.
If empty, the default value of the alias field should be set based off the title. If changes are pending and the window is closed, a confirm alert should be invoked.

## Proofs
The following proofs are in progress:
 - Angular
 - Ember
 - Backbone
 - VanillaJS

The following frameworks are being considered for future proofs:
 - CanJS
 - OneJS

[Contact JP DeVries](mailto:jp@modx.com) to request a framework or inquire about contributing.

## Resources
In `_build/templates/default` you will find an `index.html` file with a sample layout of the required elements. Base styles are included in `assets/default/` if you choose to use them.
