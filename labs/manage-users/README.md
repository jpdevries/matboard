Manage Users Lab
========

A progressively enhanced proof of concept for a Manage Users CMP&nbsp;page.

## Oh Node You Didn't
I know, I know. These concepts are written with MODX Next in mind which of course is built on PHP. This lab intends to prove front end (HTML,CSS,JS) concepts. Aside from the HTML or JSON that is served, it does not prove or have opinion of the server side architect it may one day be hooked up to. Node is used as a simple "mock" backend to provide synchronous and asynchronous end points for the user interface to interact with. Idea being, these endpoints and the HTML/JSON they return could be hooked up to PHP and the front end would be none the&nbsp;wiser.

## Twig
Twig is great! And it sounds like it will be found in MODX Next. So, it found its way into this lab as well. The Twig templates used to author the HTML via a Node backend can seamlessly be integrated with a MODX PHP&nbsp;backend.
